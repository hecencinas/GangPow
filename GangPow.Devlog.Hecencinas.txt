First commit
- Initiating the project with default pawn and default controller on purpose. The player controller is seen as a complete third person on the game;

Aim by dragging arrow implemented
- Basic character controlled on a basic AI that can stimulated by a third party (player controller, enemy team controller);
- Player controller can select a character and select an action to play, on a simple UI simulating cards;
- Made basic walking system to validate the work of the selecting/playing action is usable;
- Based on Boom Slingers. Arrow Draw is a support widget to predict shoot/throw direction;
- As Boom Slingers, it's only a successful draw if it's dragged long enough;
- As Boom Slingers, it has a limit on how much it can be dragged;
- The ArrowDraw widget support:
	- Information on last calculated velocity
	- Event for ArrowDrawUpdate
	- Basic functions for enable/disable
- Implementation of Prediction Actor Components. Prediction component uses a niagara system working with a spline to preview the line of shoot

Shooting by dragging implemented
- Implementation of simple straight shoot action

Adjustments to facilitate the implementation of multiple shoot types
- Improvement on ther implementation of actions and prediction actor components
- Simple curved shoot implementation

Basic melee strike implementation. Corrected bug with camera and arrow draw
- Created simple melee attack action implemented. Uses a MultiBoxTrace to trace what'll be attacked, those attacked use a prediction component to preview it's launch
- Detected and corrected bug related to camera rotation on the ArrowDraw widget. The implementation considered that the default pawn was roating with the camera, so the correction was just to use the camera brought by the controller


Jump action and predict walk action
- Created simple jump action
- Created prediction for walk action
